# Astroport Liquidity Helper

This contract helps provide liquidity for Astroport pools and supports supplying liquidity with imbalanced assets. If the assets provided are not in the correct ratio, the contract will swap some of the assets so that the ratio of assets are the same as the pools reserves after the swap.
